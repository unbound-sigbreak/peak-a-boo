LLM UI for Redditors

Mainly for Reddit moderators. A "LLM" button will appear to the right of a Redditor's username. Clicking this button will allow you to have an LLM of your choice analyse the comments of the user with a custom prompt. Supports Ollama and OpenAI out of the box. Ollama assumes localhost by default, but this can be changed in the API URL under "API Settings".

You can also just click "Copy Prompt" on the popup and dump that into ChatGPT, or the LLM of your choice if you do not want to setup API keys.

You must be logged into Reddit in order to use this.
